        <h1>Exercise, WEB1 Session 8 - Learning Path</h1>
        <p>Experiment with arrays, loops, and timing in JavaScript.<p>
        <ol>
            <li>Create an array with five different values (red, blue, green, black and white) and create a function which randomly picks one of the values and display it here:</li>
            <li>Use a for-loop to cycle through the array and display the five color values here:</li>  <p id="textfield"></p>
            <li>Implement a function that can show the current date and tell you the number of full days since 1/1-2018:</li><p id="date"></p>
            <li>Given the previous implementation, make a note that marks whether the number of full days since 1/1-2018 is even or odd:</li><p id="date1"></p>
            <li>Write a function which can repeatedly incremenet a value with a certain time interval between each incrementation. The time interval, the value to increment with and a reference to an element which can display the value should be arguments to the function.</li>
            <li>Used the previously created function to display two values, where one increment with 1 every second, while the other increment with 2 every other second. All incrementation should stop after 10 seconds:
                <ul>
                    <li id="counter1Id">Counter 1: </li>
                    <li id="counter2Id">Counter 2: </li>
                </ul>
            </li>
        </ol>
